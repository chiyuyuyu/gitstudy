---------

* interactive deformation 
  In the window, drag with a pointer device.
  one pair of a pressed point and a released point becomes an order to deform
  the plane. The deformation function is derived immediately and the deformed mesh
  by the function is displayed.

  Multiple dragging operations are allowed.

  make src/TestMFFDGUI

* deformatinon by predefined deformation order points
  To see the deformation, use gnuplot command 

  make src/TestMFFD

  starting gnuplot,
    plot "order.data" with line, "deformedmesh.data" with line

* deformatinon by predefined one deformation order point
  To see the deformation, use gnuplot command 

  make src/TestMFFD0

  starting gnuplot,
    plot "order.data" with line, "deformedmesh.data" with line


To understand the internal class and methd, try the following samples too

* arbitrary order uniform B-Spline basis function

  make src/TestBSpline

* uniform cubic B-Spline function

  make src/TestCubicBSpline

* 2 dimensional uniform cubic B-Spline function

  make src/TestCubicBSpline2Dimension

  use gnuplot to confirm the shape of function 
  after starting gnuplot
    splot "patch.data" with line

* 2 dimensional uniform cubic B-Spline patch
  use gnuplot to confirm the shape of function 

  make src/TestCubicBSpline2DimensionComposition

  after starting gnuplot
    splot "patch.data" with line
   
* Inner function check program
  use gnuplot to check the values in the Function W

  make src/TestFunctionW

  after startting gnuplot
    plot "order.data" with line , "deltaphais.data" with line, "controls.data" with line, "deformedmesh.data" with line
